# Claude Prompting Guide

A comprehensive guide for getting the best results when working with Claude AI.

## Core Principles

1. **Be Clear and Specific**
   - State your requirements explicitly
   - Provide context for your request
   - Specify the desired format or style of the response

2. **Use Step-by-Step Instructions**
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
   - Use numbered lists or bullet points for multiple requirements
   - Specify the order of operations when relevant

3. **Provide Examples**
   - Include positive examples of what you want
   - Include negative examples of what to avoid
   - Use sample input/output pairs for clarity

## Effective Techniques

### 1. Role and Context Setting
```
You are an expert in [field]. I need help with [specific task].
```

### 2. Format Specification
```
Please format your response as:
- Key findings:
- Detailed analysis:
- Recommendations:
```

### 3. Temperature Control
- Be explicit about whether you want creative or factual responses
- Specify if you need multiple alternatives

### 4. Using System Tags
```
<system>Please analyze this text from the perspective of a [specific role]</system>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Broad, Then Refine**
   - Begin with a general request
   - Use follow-up questions to refine the response
   - Build on previous context

2. **Specify Output Parameters**
   - Length (brief vs detailed)
   - Style (formal vs casual)
   - Format (bullet points, paragraphs, tables)

3. **Leverage Claude's Capabilities**
   - Multi-turn conversations
   - Code analysis and generation
   - Complex problem-solving
   - Document analysis

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Vague Instructions**
   - ❌ "Make this better"
   - ✅ "Improve this text by making it more concise and using simpler vocabulary"

2. **Lack of Context**
   - ❌ "What do you think about this?"
   - ✅ "Given [specific context], what are your thoughts on [specific aspect]?"

3. **Overcomplicating Requests**
   - ❌ Multiple unrelated questions in one prompt
   - ✅ Break down complex requests into separate prompts

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
```
Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, let's understand the key components
2. Then, analyze each part
3. Finally, synthesize the findings
```

### 2. Few-Shot Learning
```
Example 1:
Input: [example input]
Output: [example output]

Example 2:
Input: [example input]
Output: [example output]

Now, please process this:
Input: [actual input]
```

### 3. Role-Playing Scenarios
```
Act as [specific role] and help me with [specific task].
Consider these aspects:
1. [relevant aspect 1]
2. [relevant aspect 2]
```

## Tips for Specific Use Cases
